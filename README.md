# Logistic-Regression-with-Gradient-Descent-on-heart-disease-dataset
To predict the cardiac disease logistic regression ML model is used, firstly the LR model are trained with five splitting condition and tested with test data for prediction to get the best accuracy and to find the models behavior. The algorithm results category of 1 and 0 for presence and absences of cardiac disease.
